Please download the Ham Spam dataset files to data folder and extract them to respective folders (hw1, enron1, enron4).

Used Python3(3.9) and Anaconda Environment & Packaging Tool

Run "check_modules.py" to check whether all the dependency modules installed or not.

Need to pass the dataset path as argument to each of the file to run on the respective dataset.
eg: $python_path $project_path/Multinomial_Naive_Bayes.py $data_path/hw1

Else run the "run.sh" shell script by configuring the python path, project path and dataset paths in the script file.
This will run the all algorithms on all the datasets and outputs the all four metrics for each model and data representation combination.
